API creation with NodeJS and MongoDB using Fastify

This is a Node.js project about building an API from scratch using Fastify and MongoDB.
Fastify is used in this project because it offers a powerful plugin architecture and boasts impressive performance, making it a great choice for building our Node.js API.
MongoDB is used in this project because it is the most popular NoSQL DataBase, which comes with great package support for Node.JS and makes it easy to store structured or unstructured data by using a JSON-like format to store documents.
"pnpm" is used rather than "npm" to manage dependencies efficiently, as it helps by utilizing shared modules on your system, reducing download times and storage usage.
